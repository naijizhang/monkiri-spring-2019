# Description

This is the capstone project at RED Academy App Developer Program, where we applied what we have learned to create a fully functioning Financial Learning App for our client. This App allows users to log in and access Financial learning modules where users are able to interact with the lessons to increase their knowledge. This project consisted of us all working in an Agile team and collaborating through GitHub.
